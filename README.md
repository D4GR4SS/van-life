# VAN-LIFE: React Router App üöê

This application was built for the purpose of practicing and learning React Router.

## Overview

üåê The React Router Practice App is a travel van rental application that I've just started building while following [@scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)'s Advanced React course. The goal is to implement and understand the concepts of routing in a React application using React Router. The app may include multiple pages, each serving a specific purpose, and navigation between these pages is achieved through the use of React Router.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: A standard library for routing in React applications.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-router-practice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd react-router-practice
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Netlify. You can visit it at [Your Netlify App URL](https://vanlife44-react-router.netlify.app/).
